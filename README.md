Components repo displays components which are made for developers to easily integrate in their applications. All components include Chute SDK library and are used for different social activities.

All components are written for the Android OS and assume you have the basic knowledge of JAVA and Android programming, that you have the android SDK and JDK setup and you are using Eclipse IDE with the android developer tools plugins installed. Since most of the components will work with code samples written for Android, any IDE other than Eclipse might be used for development.
